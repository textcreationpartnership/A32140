            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE knowledge I had of the deſires of my Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Subjects, was the cauſe of my calling the laſt Aſſembly of Parliament, wherein had I been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, I ſincerely thinke, that things had not falne out as now We ſee. But it is no wonder that men are ſo ſlow to beleeve that ſo great a ſedition ſhould bee raiſed on ſo little ground. But now my Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the honour and ſafety of this Kingdome lying ſo neerely at the ſtake, I am reſolved to put my ſelf freely and cleerly on the love and affections of my Engliſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as theſe of my Lords that did wait on me at York, very well remember I there declared. Therefore my Lords, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not mention mine own intereſt, or that ſupport
<hi>I</hi> might juſtly expect from you, till the common ſafety be ſecured; though <hi>I</hi> muſt tell you <hi>I</hi> am not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſay, thoſe charges <hi>I</hi> have been at, have been meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſecuring and good of this Kingdome, though the ſucceſſe hath not been anſwerable to my deſires. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> ſhall onely deſire you to conſider the beſt way both for the ſafety and ſecurity of this Kingdome, wherein there are two parts chiefly conſiderable. Firſt, the chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the Rebells. And ſecondly, the other in ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying your juſt grievances, wherein <hi>I</hi> ſhall promiſe you to concur ſo heartily and cleerly with you, that all the <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42720:3"/>world may ſee my intentions have ever beene, and ſhall be, to make this a glorious and flouriſhing Kingdome. There are onely two things that <hi>I</hi> ſhall mention to you: Firſt, the one is to tell you that the Loan of money which
<hi>I</hi> lately had from the City of London, wherin the Lords that waited upon me at Yorke aſſiſted me, will onely maintaine my Army for two months from the beginning of that time it was granted. Now my Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<hi>I</hi> leave it to your conſiderations, what diſhonour and miſchiefe it might be, in caſe for want of mony my Army be disbanded, before the Rebels be put out of this Kingdome. Secondly, the ſecuring the calamities the Northern people endure at this time, and ſo long as the treaty is on foot. And in this <hi>I</hi> may ſay not onely they, but all this Kingdome will ſuffer the harm; therefore <hi>J</hi> leave this alſo to your conſideration, for the ordering of theſe great affaires whereof you are to treat at this time. <hi>J</hi> am ſo confident of your love to me, &amp; that yor care is for the honour and ſafety of the Kingdome, that <hi>I</hi> ſhall freely and willingly leave to you where to begin: onely this, that you may the better know the ſtate of all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. <hi>J</hi> have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded my L. Keeper to give you a ſhort and free account of theſe things that have happened in this interim, with this proteſtation, that if this account be not ſatisfactory as it ought to be, <hi>J</hi> ſhall whenſover you deſire, give you a full and perfect account of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. One thing more
<hi>J</hi> deſire of you, as one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt meanes to make this a happy Parliament; That you on your parts, as <hi>J</hi> on mine, lay aſide all ſuſpition one of another, as <hi>J</hi> promiſed my Lords at York:
<hi>Jt</hi> ſhall not be my fault if this be not a happy and good Parliament.</p>

            <p>I Do expect that you wil haſtily make relation to the Houſe of Commons of thoſe great affairs for which <hi>I</hi> have called you hither at this time, and for the truſt <hi>I</hi> have repoſed in them, and how freely <hi>I</hi> put my ſelfe on their love and affections at that time; and that you may know the better how to doe ſo, <hi>I</hi> will explain my ſelfe concerning one thing <hi>I</hi> ſpake the laſt day. <hi>I</hi> told you the Rebels muſt be put out of this Kingdome; it's true, <hi>I</hi> muſt needs call them ſo, ſo long as they have an Army that do invade us; &amp; although <hi>I</hi> am under treaty with them, and <hi>I</hi> under my great Seal do call them ſubjects, and ſo they are too, but the ſtate of my affairs in ſhort, is this: it's true, <hi>I</hi> did expect when <hi>I</hi> did will my Lords and great ones at <hi>York</hi> to have given a gracious anſwer to all your grievances; for <hi>I</hi> was in good hope by their wiſedoms &amp; aſſiſtances to have made an end of that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; but <hi>I</hi> muſt tell you, that my ſubjects of
<hi>Scotland</hi> did ſo delay them, that it was not poſſible to end there: therefore <hi>J</hi> can no wayes blame my Lords that were at

<hi>J</hi> ſhall conclude nothing without your knowledge, and <hi>J</hi> doubt not but by your appr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Knights, Citizens, Burgeſſes; the principall cauſe of my comming here at this time, is, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſlow proceedings in Parliament, touching which is a great deale of inconvenience.</p>
            <p>Therefore I think it very neceſſary to lay before you the ſtate of my affairs as now they ſtand, thereby to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten (not interrupt) your proceedings.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I muſt remember you that there are two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Kingdome in a manner maintained by you, the very naming of which, doth more clearly ſhew the inconvenience thereof, then a better tongue then mine can expreſſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the firſt place, I ſhall recommend unto you the quicke diſpatch of that buſineſſe, aſſuring you that it cannot reſt upon me.</p>
            <p>In the next place I muſt recommend unto you the ſtate of my Navie &amp; Forts; the condition of both which is ſo well known unto you, that I need not tell you the particulars, only thus much, they are the walls and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this Kingdome, which if out of order, all men may eaſily judge what incouragement it will be to our <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42720:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>enemies, and what diſheartning to our friends.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, (and not of the leaſt to be conſidered) I muſt lay before you the diſtractions that are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſioned through the cauſe of Parliament; for there are ſome men that more maliciouſly then igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, will put no difference between reformation and alteration of government.</p>
            <p>Hence it commeth that divine Service is irreverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted, and Petitions in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll way given in, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſputed nor denied. But I will enter into no more particulars, but ſhew you a way of remedy, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you my cleare intentions, and ſome mark that may hinder this good work.</p>
            <p>I ſhall willingly and cheerfully concur with you for the reformation of all innovations both in Church and Common wealth, and conſequently that all Courts of Iuſtice may be reformed according to Law. For my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is clearly to reduce all things to the beſt &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt times, as they were in the time of Qu. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, whatſoever part of my revenue ſhall bee found illegal or heavy to my ſubjects, I ſhall be willing to lay down, truſting in their affections. Having thus clearly and ſhortly ſet down my intentions, I wil ſhew you ſome rubs, and muſt needs take notice of ſome very ſtrange (I know not what tearme to give them) Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given in the name of divers Counties, againſt the eſtabliſhed government of the Church, and of the great threatnings againſt the Biſhops, that they will make them to be but a Cipher, or at leaſt taken away.</p>
            <p>If ſome of them have incroached too much upon the Temporalty (if it be ſo) <hi>I</hi> ſhall not be unwilling theſe things ſhould be redreſſed and reformed, as all other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, according to the wiſedome of former times; ſo farre <hi>I</hi> ſhall goe with you, no farther.</p>
            <p>If upon ſerious debate, you ſhall ſhew, that Biſhops have ſome temporall authority, not ſo neceſſary for the <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42720:5"/>government of the Church, and upholding Epiſcopall juriſdiction,
<hi>I</hi> ſhall not be unwilling to deſire them to lay it downe; but this muſt not bee underſtood, that <hi>I</hi> ſhall any way conſent that their voyce in Parliamen ſhould be taken away: for in all the times of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors ſince the Conqueſt, and before, they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it;
<hi>I</hi> am bound to maintaine them in it, as one of the fundamentall inſtitutions of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>There is one other rock you are on not in ſubſtance but in ſervice; and the forme is ſo eſſentiall, that unleſſe it be reformed, will ſplit you on that rock.</p>
            <p>There is a Bill lately put in concerning Parliaments. The thing
<hi>I</hi> like well to have frequent Parliaments, but for Sheriffes and Conſtables to uſe my authority, <hi>I</hi> can no wayes conſent unto.</p>
            <p>But to ſhew that <hi>I</hi> defire to give you content in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as well as in ſhew, that you ſhall have a Bill for doing thereof, ſo that it doe not trench neither againſt my Honour, neither againſt the ancient prerogatives of the Crowns concerning Parliaments, ingeniouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, often Parliaments is the fitteſt means to keep correſpondency between Me and my people, that <hi>I</hi> doe ſo much deſire.</p>
            <p>To conclude, now all that <hi>I</hi> have ſhewn you, the ſtate of my affaires, my owne cleare intentions, and the rockes <hi>I</hi> would have you ſhun.</p>
            <p>To give you all contentment, you ſhall likewiſe find by theſe Miniſters, <hi>I</hi> have or ſhall have about mee for the effecting of theſe my good intentions, which ſhall redouble the peace of the Kingdome, and content you all. Concerning the conference you ſhall have a direct anſwer on Munday, which ſhall give you ſatisfaction.</p>

            <p>MY Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons; you may remember when both Houſes were with me at the banquetting Houſe at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> I did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you two rocks I wiſhed you to eſchew, this is the one of them, and of that conſequence, that I think never bill paſſed here in this Houſe of more favour to the Subjects then this is, and if the other Rock bee as happily paſſed over as this ſhall be at this time, I doe not know what you can ask, for ought I can ſee it this time, that I can make any queſtion to yeeld unto: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I mention this to ſhew unto you the ſence that I have of this Bill, and obligation, as I may ſay, that you have to me for it, for hitherto, to ſpeake freely, I have had no great incouragement to doe it; if I ſhould look to the outward face of your actions or proceedings, and not look to the inward intentions of your hearts, I might make queſtion of doing it.</p>
            <p>Hitherto you have gone on in that which concernes your ſelves to amend, and yet thoſe things that meerly <pb n="10" facs="tcp:42720:6"/>concernes the ſtrength of this Kingdom, neither for the State nor my own particular.</p>
            <p>This I mention, not to reproach you but to ſhew you the ſtate of things as they are, you have taken the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment all in pieces, and I may ſay, it is almoſt off the hinges.</p>
            <p>A skilfull Watchmaker to make clean his watch, he will take it a ſunder, and when it is put together, it will goe the better, ſo that he leave not foorth not one pin in it.</p>
            <p>Now as I have done all this on my part, you know what to do on your parts, and I hope you ſhal ſee cleerly that I have performed really what I expreſſed to you at the beginning of this Parliament, of the great truſt I have of your affections to me, and this is the great expreſſion of truſt, that before you do any thing for me, that I do put ſuch a confidence in you.</p>

            <p>HAving taken into my ſerious conſideration, the late Remonſtrance made unto me by the Houſe of Parliament, I give you this anſwere.</p>

            <p>I am reſolved to provide against the Ieſuits and Papiſts, by ſetting foorth a Proclamation with
